# autoGrader

This project was started to make grading 'Peer Evaluations' much quicker and less prone to human error. Previously, TAs would have to sort through hundreds of peer evaluations and manually concatenate relevant information for each student. 

This program simplifies the process. All a professor needs to do is dump all the files into one directory that have all been submitted with a (not very) specific naming scheme that simply needs a group members name and their team number somewhere in the file name. 

By creating a new (user specified) directory to sort all of the files per group using standard Python libraries, and then sifting through the peer evaluation Excel files using an open-source library called openpyxl.
