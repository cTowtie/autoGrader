# autoGrader

This project was started to make grading 'Peer Evaluations' much quicker and less prone to human error. Previously, TAs would have to sort through hundreds of peer evaluations and manually concatenate relevant information for each student. 

This program simplifies the process, and saves the relevant parties many very painful hours. All a professor needs to do is dump all the files into one directory that have all been submitted with a (not very) specific naming scheme that simply needs a group members team number in the file name.

By creating a new (user specified) directory to sort all of the files into, separated by group, using standard Python libraries, and then sifting through the peer evaluation Excel files using an open-source library called openpyxl, this tool makes it quick and simple for an unlimited amount of students to be graded and handed feedback.
